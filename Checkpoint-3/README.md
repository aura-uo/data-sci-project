### Supported browsers

### Bubble Chart
To view the bubble chart visualization, open the html file "bubble_chart". Each bubble represents each unit, and the size of the bubble represents the settlement costs (total over time). Hover over the bubbles for more information.

### Line chart
To view the line charts visualization, open the html file "line_chart_districts". Use the select drop-down to select and view data for a police district in Chicago. The chart shows the ratio of total disciplines to total complaints over the years. This ratio is on the y-axis and time (years) is on the x-axis. 

### Data Sources
To get the data for our visualizations, we used the queries in the file "cp3.sql". Then, we performed some data cleaning using Python, as seen in the files "parse_unit_settlements_data" and "parse_district_data".
