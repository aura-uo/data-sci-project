# Settlement and Discipline in the Chicago Police Department
*The Wicked Roadrunners - Kylie Chesner, Nimesh Tripathi, Aura Ulloa-Ordonez*

Hi, this is our quarter-long-project, for the class, Data Science Seminar, where we use data from the Invisible Institute's Citizen's Police Data Project, to determine settlement and disciplinary actions by the Chicago Police Department. We aimed to work with these two categories, as they are markers of correctionary measures against misconduct. It also represents the general culture of the Police Department in Chicago, and how they conduct their daily responsibilities.

We have attached links to all our checkpoints below, and the final project report has been attached at the end. All the respective Readme.md files in the respective checkpoints, which give information on how to run the code, and the questions that we answered in the respective checkpoints.

Thanks.
