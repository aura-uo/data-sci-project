# Checkpoint 2

## Getting Started

### Running Tableau
All charts are saved in a Tableau notebook. As long as the user has Tableau, there should be no issues with being able to see the visualizations through it. If there are then, please download the CVS files as well since the visualizations were built from locally with those files. The SQL file is only present for transparency and to show what queries we used to get the CVS files.

### Our Questions
* How much settlement costs do officers grouped by their common allegation cause?
* How does rank influence discipline? Is there any ranks more likely than others to be disciplined?
* Is there any relationship between the number of awards and the number of disciplines per unit?

### Our Visualizations
* Two bar charts with one showing the average settlement cost and another showing total settlements of all officers grouped by their most common allegation/complaint type.
* A bar chart showing average amount of disciplines for every rank.
* A scatterplot with the number of rewards on the x-axis and the number of disciplines on the y. Quantities are per unit.
