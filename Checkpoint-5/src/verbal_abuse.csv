It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation.

It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization.

1385,"On 03 July 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding various incidents occurring in the 2nd District, in which an off-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly threatened to kill the victim during a telephone argument, engaged in physical domestic altercations with the victim at various times, failed to properly secure his firearm during one of these domestic altercations, locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration, did not return the victims personal items after she moved out of the domicile, destroyed her clothes and shoes, used his official position for personal gain/influence in that he obtained the victims criminal history, and associated/fraternized with a convicted felon. In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim. During the course of IPRAs investigation, no independent witnesses nor 911 calls for domestic disturbances at the accuseds apartment were found to corroborate the multiple incidents of physical domestic altercations between the victim and the accused officer. To this end, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations of the physical altercations, that the accused failed to secure his firearm during one of these altercations, and that the accused locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration. Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.
