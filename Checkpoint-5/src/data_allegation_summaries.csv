It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization.

"On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation.

"On 03 July 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding various incidents occurring in the 2nd District, in which an off-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly threatened to kill the victim during a telephone argument, engaged in physical domestic altercations with the victim at various times, failed to properly secure his firearm during one of these domestic altercations, locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration, did not return the victims personal items after she moved out of the domicile, destroyed her clothes and shoes, used his official position for personal gain/influence in that he obtained the victims criminal history, and associated/fraternized with a convicted felon. In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim. During the course of IPRAs investigation, no independent witnesses nor 911 calls for domestic disturbances at the accuseds apartment were found to corroborate the multiple incidents of physical domestic altercations between the victim and the accused officer. To this end, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations of the physical altercations, that the accused failed to secure his firearm during one of these altercations, and that the accused locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration. Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.

According to the 911 caller, an African American male, wearing a tan jacket, was hitting an African American female dressed in black. Upon arrival to the scene, responding officers observed complainant Subject 1, an African American male, escorting Civilian 1, an African American female. Subject 1, who was dressed in a tan jacket, appeared to be forcing his darkly?dressed companion to walk along. Considering 1) that Subject 1 and Civilian matched the description provided by the 911 caller; 2) that Subject 1 and Civilian were in the location provided by the 911 caller; and, 3) Subject 1?s unusual actions with Civilian 1, Officer A decided to investigate the situation. When Officer A inquired if Subject 1 and Civilian were okay, Subject 1 stated that they were fine, but would not allow Civilian to respond. Subject 1 then began to move away from the responding officers, apparently hiding something in his pocket, while using Civilian to shield his actions. Given the nature of the 911 call that brought Officer A to the scene, Officer A became concerned for the safety of Civilian 1. At this point, Subject 1 was handcuffed and separated from Civilian 1. Once away from Subject 1, Civilian 1 stated that Subject 1 had been physical with her, but that she was unwilling to press charges. Civilian 1 also stated that she had been taking PCP with Subject 1, prompting Officer A to call for an ambulance. When asked, Subject 1 also admitted to getting high on PCP with Civilian 1. After running a name check on Subject 1, Officer A released Subject 1, providing Subject 1 with an investigatory stop receipt. Later in the evening, Subject 1 traveled to Hospital A, complaining that his wrists hurt. A Chicago Police Sergeant and Evidence Technician visited Subject 1 at the hospital, where photos were taken of Subject 1. These photos show very light marking on Subject 1?s wrists. On February 3, 2016, Subject 1 came in to IPRA to report his involvement in the incident.

After inspecting the item Officer A returned the item to the front passenger seat and closed the passenger side door. Although Subject 1 claimed that Officer A searched the passenger side seat, video confirmed that no further search of the vehicle was conducted.
